The subfolder [./analysis](./analysis) contains code to replicate Table 1 and 2. These are the primary replication files. Analysis data can be found at openICPSR (DOI: [10.3886/E100505V1](http://doi.org/10.3886/E100505V1)). Replication data should be downloaded and stored in the [./analysis](./analysis) folder.

The subfolder [./build](./build) contains code used to generate the analysis data from raw input files from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI). The README file in that folder provides complete details on the provenance of the input data sources, which are freely available from the BLS and Virtual Research Data Center.
